download only audio from youtube video using youtube-dl in python script

                   There's a few posts on downloading audio from YouTube using youtube-dl, but none of them are concrete or
                   too helpful. I'm wondering what the best way to do it from a Python script is.

                   For example, here's the README example for downloading videos:

                   import youtube_dl

                   ydl_opts = {}
                   with youtube_dl.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:
                       ydl.download(['http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc'])

up vote 4 down     Obviously if you just care about the audio, you'd rather not download the whole video...

                   Any suggestions how to script this?

                   python audio youtube youtube-dl

               Read on in the developer instructions for an amended example:

               from __future__ import unicode_literals
               import youtube_dl


               ydl_opts = {
                   'format': 'bestaudio/best',
                   'postprocessors': [{
                       'key': 'FFmpegExtractAudio',
                       'preferredcodec': 'mp3',
                       'preferredquality': '192',
up vote 6 down     }],
vote accepted  }
               with youtube_dl.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:
                   ydl.download(['http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaW_jenozKc'])

               This will download an audio file if possible/supported. If the file is not mp3 already, the downloaded file be
               converted to mp3 using ffmpeg or avconv. For more information, refer to the format and postprocessors
               documentation entries in a current version of youtube-dl.
